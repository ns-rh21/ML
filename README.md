Machine Learning
note1:
working with https://github.dev/

 You could not work with *.ipynb in Github. so editing it with https://github.dev/.
 if your computer can not find Kernel you should write this command im anaconda cmd: 
 jupyter notebook --no-browser --NotebookApp.allow_origin='*'
 after that in cmd you can see this lines
  To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///C:/Users/nasib/AppData/Roaming/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-11484-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://localhost:8892/?token=22f6e5e3c9fa8ceb9a779f6128fe1f61e6ab8894bb5e1461
     or http://127.0.0.1:8892/?token=22f6e5e3c9fa8ceb9a779f6128fe1f61e6ab8894bb5e1461
     you must copy this address in the kernel that dev wants.
     these codes in cmd show that you have a new kernel in dev
